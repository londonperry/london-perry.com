## Professional

I am a full time Web Developer & Data Analyst. I have spent the last 5 years turning raw data into something useful, and I now know that it's just something that is baked into how I operate. Outside of the 9-5 I spend by time building new things on modern tech stacks of the Jamstack variety.

## Personal

I am a Boise, Idaho native and still live here with my daughter Eden, girlfriend Brittney and dog Atlas. I am an avid watcher of anime, professional spooky story teller (as my daughter says), and always looking for the next challenge.
